#Project 1:

This program allows the user to enter:
"playsong" "input file" "output file"
and it will read that input file and make a song or all the parts specified. 

This will first read the 'WAVE' part of the input file, then the 'SOUND' part 
and lastly the 'SONG' part of it. 

Then it will create a sound based on the input file and output that sound to 
the specified output file that the user had previosly entered.
