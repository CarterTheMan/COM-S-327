# COM-S-327
This is an archive of my projects from the course COM S 327 (Advanced Programming techniques) at Iowa State University from the fall of 2020

For this class I learned memory management, parameter passing, file input and output, inheritance, and compiling in C and C++.

'Project 1' is entirely in C while 'Project 2' and the 'Final' both use C and C++. This was a very difficult class and we very difficult as it was online during COVID, but I learned how to use both C and C++ in large scale projects so it was absoutely worth it. 
Each project had a PDF with instructions for how the project was supposed to work in the end and gave some rough guidelines to follow, but was mostly up to us to get it to work. One of these PDFs is provided in the 'Final' project.
